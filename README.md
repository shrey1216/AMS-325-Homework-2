Shreyan Wankavala Estimating Pi Mini-Project:

The files included serve to estimate the value of pi using the Monte Carlo method, but by using for loops and while loops. 

The first method uses a for loop which continues until the value given as the argument is reached. 
The higher the value given into the function, the more accurate the estimation of pi. 

The second method uses a while loop and takes in a tolerance level to be compared with the error for each estimate of pi. 
For this method, a desired level of accuracy can be chosen based on the tol level, but the performance of the program is compromised.


Both functions are plot. 
The for loop is plot with a second line for the error of each value. 

The while loop is plot for its performance using tic toc, as lower tol values increase the time taken to run the program dramatically. 

A modification to the for loop was also made.
The modification allows you to watch the points being plotted in real time using VideoWriter. 


Each function has an accompanying script file which can run the code and plot the respective graph.
